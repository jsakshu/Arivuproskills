# 🔁 Python `while` Loop – Introduction for Beginners

## 📘 What is a `while` Loop?

A `while` loop is used to **repeat a block of code** as long as a specified condition is `True`.

---

## 🔧 Syntax

```python
while condition:
    # code block to execute


The condition is checked before the loop body runs.

The code block will keep repeating until the condition becomes False.



Make sure the loop eventually stops by changing the condition inside the loop.

Otherwise, it may result in an infinite loop.



###Example 1: Print "Hello" 5 times

count = 1
while count <= 5:
    print("Hello")
    count += 1
